## Overview

In light of the rising number of original films being produced by major corporations, Microsoft has tasked me to evaluate the movie industry's prospects and make recommendations before they can make any decisions. My assessment involved measuring the profitability of specific genres using return on investment as a metric. Additionally, I scrutinized the movie box office's top-performing studios and examined the most popular genres with high viewer ratings to arrive at my findings.s.

## Business Problem

Microsoft's challenge is the already existing video content market by well known competitors such as Netflix, Amazon etc. As such it must create content that can rival these established competitors, attract and retain viewers.

The only way this is possible is for Microsoft to distinguish itself by making significant investments in content development, talent acquisition and marketing, gaining a deep understanding of audience preferences and trends and establishing a monetization strategy that balances the costs of content creation with revenue streams such as advertising or subscriptions.

In light of the above, my assessment will seek to:

Determine the most popular genre
Examine the relationship between production expenditures and ROI
Identifying the top-performing studios in the movie industry.

To determine the most popular genre, I analyzed data on audience preferences and trends and also scrutinized the correlation between production expenses and revenue.

The following datasets were provided to gain more insights on the performance of different attributes of movies.
* Box Office Mojos
* IMDB
* TheMovieDB.
* The Numbers

My analysis utilized three datasets Box Office Mojos, IMDB and The Numbers based on the sufficient data attributes that will provide insights for Microsoft.

The first dataset, bom.movie_gross.csv, has five columns comprising of movie titles, studios, financial incomes both domestic and foreign and the release year.

The second dataset, tn.movie_budgets.csv, contains information on released films, including their names, release dates, and financial data such as production budget and worldwide gross. The key variable for this dataset is the ROI, and the monetary data columns are the primary reason for selecting this dataset.

The third dataset, tmdb.movies.csv, contains genre codes, original language of the movies, original movie titles, popularity metrics, dates in which the movies were released, and information on the votes. I used this dataset to map genre codes to genre names obtained from the same website so that I could see which genres are more trending.

Data Analysis
The analysis phase focuses on exploring the relationships in the previously prepared data to help make an analysis of the given data.

## Findings

- My findings indicate that the correlation between production budget and return on investment is weakly positive, suggesting that higher production budgets do not necessarily guarantee higher returns. Therefore, Microsoft may need to exercise caution in managing its production costs and investments to ensure a profitable return on investment.

- There is a strong positive correlation between worldwide gross and production budget, implying that higher-budget films tend to have a wider reach and generate higher box office revenue. This suggests that Microsoft should consider investing in high-budget productions to maximize its revenue potential.

- The 'Horror' and 'Music' genres tend to have a higher return on investment, while 'Action' and 'Adventure' are the most popular genres. These insights suggest that Microsoft may want to focus on producing films in these genres to increase its profitability.

- From my analysis it appears that Microsoft has the opportunity to enter the film industry by acquiring intellectual property rights from top movie studios. However, as Microsoft lacks experience in film production, it may face challenges in adapting to the industry's unique characteristics.

To summarize, while Microsoft has the potential to enter the film industry through the acquisition of intellectual property rights, it will need to be mindful of production costs and focus on high-budget productions to maximize revenue. Additionally, Microsoft may want to consider producing films in profitable genres such as Horror, Music, Action, and Adventure to increase its profitability.

## Recommendations

To successfully enter the film industry, Microsoft should:

1. Conduct thorough market research
2. Partner with experienced film producers
3. Develop a clear investment strategy to include factors such as genre preferences, production budget, and revenue potential.
4. Focus on high-budget productions
5. Consider producing films in popular and profitable genres
6. Take steps to protect its intellectual property rights to safeguard its investments in the film industry.
